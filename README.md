Introduction: Our project, titled DonorConnect, is a web application developed to simplify and digitize the blood donation process. It allows donors, patients, and administrators to interact with the system for donating, requesting, and managing blood-related data in a streamlined manner. Purpose of the Project: We decided to proceed with this project by drawing inspiration from the story narrated by Sushmita about her close relative, who faced numerous challenges while donating blood at the blood bank. Also, experiences shared by other members. We chose to develop this project using Python and the Django framework. Our primary motivation was to explore Python as a programming language, and Django was the ideal choice due to its built-in features, including authentication, an admin interface, and the ability to easily connect with databases using ORM (Object Relational Mapping). We also used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design a responsive and user-friendly front end. My Contribution: Built the project using HTML, CSS, and primarily JavaScript.

Developed login and registration forms for Admin, Patient, and Donor roles.

Added form validation:

Password must be at least 8 characters, with letters and numbers.

Mobile number must be exactly 10 digits.

Gained valuable experience in JavaScript, especially in form handling and validation.

Learned the basics of Python and Django, as it was my first time working with them.

Understood how Django connects with SQL databases and handles user authentication.

This project improved both my front-end and back-end development skills.
